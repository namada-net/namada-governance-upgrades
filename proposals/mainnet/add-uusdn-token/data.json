    "details": "This proposal looks to add support for USDN (Noble’s native yield-bearing stablecoin) to Namada’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP), whitelist USDN as a gas token, and set initial rate-limit parameters. Adding USDN would make it the first yield-bearing stable asset in the MASP, enabling shielded deposits that generate real yield and expanding the economic functionality of shielded assets. Whitelisting USDN for gas ensures a seamless user experience, allowing transactions to be paid directly in USDN. The initial parameters are a ___M global mint limit, ___M per-epoch limit, and a gas price of ___ uusdn per gas unit.",
